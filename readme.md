# Resource Goals

I have created this resource for two primary reasons:

## Reason 1

To provide an easy-to-read and understandable introduction to basic algorithms and tools for algorithmic programming, covering a wide range of interesting and useful topics. Similar to the resources hosted on my previous blog, like my "Introduction to Quantum Computing". 

## Reason 2

To showcase my coding style and capabilities by creating a portfolio of both explanations and implementations of advanced mathematical techniques. As an engineer by background, I would like to demonstrate my mathematical ability, particularly if I plan to further my studies and pursue pure mathematics. Since it's harder to go purer in STEM than more applied, this portfolio will serve as proof of my self-taught skills.

# Resource Structure

To achieve these goals, the resource is divided into two main sections:

## Section 1

Implementations of basic algorithms with clear explanations of the underlying concepts.

## Section 2

An explanation of the underlying mathematics.

# Mathematics Section

To expand my mathematical knowledge, I plan to learn from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, which offers rich and in-depth resources. My friends who are studying it will also be invaluable in helping me learn.

The mathematics section will cover the following topics in sequence:

1. IA Probability
2. IA Analysis I
3. IB Linear Algebra
4. IB Analysis II
5. IB Markov Chains
6. IB Methods
7. IB Complex Methods (with some proofs from IB Complex Analysis*)
8. IB Statistics
9. IB Optimisation
10. II Probability and Measure
11. II Statistical Physics**
12. III Advanced Probability
13. III Combinatorics
14. III Modern Statistical Methods
15. III Percolation and Random Walks on Graphs
16. III Stochastic Calculus and Applications

Each section will address additional pre-knowledge as needed.

*From my understanding and brief reading of these topics, Complex Analysis is not essential to have a foundation of each of the advanced topics. 

**Understanding phase transitions is useful but not required to be understood rigorously.
