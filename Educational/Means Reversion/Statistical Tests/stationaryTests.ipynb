    "# Time Series Processes\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Stationarity is an important property to understand in time-series analysis. If a time-series is stationary, the mean, variance, and covariance do change over time. In financial signals, this means the price of an asset will return to they're mean price.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fact could allow you to take advantages of deviations from the mean to execute predictions from the time series.\n",

    "As the name sugggests, this is a variation of the DF test. It allows us to apply the DF test to a wider range of time-series models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we extend the model to:\n",
    "$$ \\Delta y_{t} = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} \\delta_{1} \\Delta y_{t-1} + ... + \\delta_{p-1} \\Delta y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_{t}, where t<0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have $\\alpha$ is a constant, $\\beta$ is the cofficient on a time-wise trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have $\\alpha,\\beta = 0$ the trend cannot drift overtime because there is no proportianal factor to $\\Delta y_{t}$, nor a geometric progression of $y_{t}$ wrt to time. When both these constraints are met, the model is a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "When just the $\\beta = 0$ criterion is satisfied, it follows that it is a geometrically progressing random walk.\n",
